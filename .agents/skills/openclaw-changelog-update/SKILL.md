# OpenClaw Changelog Update

Use this for changelog rewrites and GitHub release-note source text. For regular
beta/stable, prepare complete notes before final-source qualification when
possible; Code SHA may then also be Release SHA. Editorial work may overlap
Code validation. If notes change afterward, a genuine CHANGELOG-only descendant
may use the existing product-evidence reuse policy. For
extended-stable, run it before final exact-head validation and tagging. Do not
rerun it for tooling retries, resumed publication, or promotion.
Use it with `release-openclaw-maintainer`; this skill owns changelog content,
ordering, grouping, and attribution discipline.

## Goal

Rebuild the target `CHANGELOG/YYYY.M.PATCH.md` release section from a complete, generated
history manifest, not stale draft notes. Produce grouped user-facing release
notes sorted by user interest while preserving every relevant issue/PR ref and
every human `Thanks @...` attribution.

`CHANGELOG.md` is the generated release index. The shared owner
`scripts/lib/release-changelog.mjs` resolves release sections and contribution
records from a working tree or a pinned Git ref, including historical refs
that still contain a monolith. Use `node scripts/release-changelog.mjs read
--version <version> [--ref <sha-or-tag>]` for a section, or add `--record` for
its contribution record. A missing split artifact must not fall back to the
root index. Historical releases without records gain no invented provenance.
Generated `CHANGELOG/**` files retain exact migrated or mirrored bytes and are
excluded from generic formatting, like the root changelog. Validate them through
their owner with `pnpm changelog:check`.

Current writes use the split layout. To save a complete initial section, use
`node scripts/release-changelog.mjs write --version <version> --file <section.md>`;
it updates the release entry, matching `CHANGELOG/records/<version>.md` when
present, and index together. Initial generation retains the section format
below. Published docs mirrors follow the separate post-release route at the end
of this skill; initial generation must never overwrite them.

## Inputs

- Target base version: `YYYY.M.PATCH`, without beta suffix.
- Base tag: last reachable shipped release tag, usually the previous stable or
  the previous beta train requested by the operator. It must be an ancestor of
  the target; a newer but divergent tag is not a valid history boundary. Use
  an explicit shipped/main-closeout SHA only when it is also reachable from the
  target.
- Target ref: the exact product-complete history being documented. Its
  contribution-record target must be an ancestor of the final release target;
  it need not name a not-yet-created changelog commit. Include any later fixes
  before finalizing notes. Final notes may be committed before qualification,
  or afterward as a CHANGELOG-only descendant of a green Code SHA.
- Canonical main ref: current `origin/main`, fetched before verification. Release
  notes cite the original merged main PR when the same work is carried by a
  backport. A release-branch PR is used only while no forward-port exists on
  current main.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the release branch and exact history target:
   - `git fetch --tags origin`
   - confirm clean `git status -sb`
   - record `git rev-parse HEAD` as the history target
   - record the Full Release Validation run id and attempt when qualification already exists
   - finish pending product/version/backport changes before freezing final source; refresh the inventory for actual changes
2. Audit history, including direct commits:
   - `git log --topo-order --date=iso-strict --pretty=format:'%h%x09%ad%x09%s' <base-tag>..<target-ref>`
   - `git log --topo-order --grep='(#' --date=short --pretty=format:'%h%x09%ad%x09%s' <base-tag>..<target-ref>`
   - Include every commit reachable from the target but not the base, including merged side branches. Resolve PR associations before deduplicating and subtracting shipped records; retain the existing revert exclusions.
   - also inspect `--since='24 hours ago'` when main moved during the release.
3. Generate the complete contribution record and editorial manifest before
   writing grouped prose:

   ```bash
   node --import tsx .agents/skills/openclaw-changelog-update/scripts/verify-release-notes.mjs \
     --base <base-tag> \
     --target <target-ref> \
     --main-ref origin/main \
     --version <YYYY.M.PATCH> \
     --manifest /tmp/openclaw-release-<YYYY.M.PATCH>.json \
     --write-ledger
   ```

   Add repeatable `--release-provenance '<40sha> -> #PR[, #PR]'` inputs when
   release commits cannot carry provenance metadata. These use the same exact
   marker grammar and current-main validation as commit-body markers.

   The verifier automatically reuses public GitHub GraphQL responses from an
   exact base/target SHA snapshot under the worktree's git metadata. Iterative
   rewrites at the same target avoid repeated network discovery. Use
   `--refresh-github-snapshot` after suspect API data, `--github-snapshot
<path>` for an explicit artifact, or `--no-github-snapshot` for a live-only
   audit. GitHub release bodies are always read live.
   Explicit `CI #`, `CI run #`, `Actions run #`, and `workflow run #` references
   in active source are classified separately only when issue/PR resolution
   fails and a live same-repository Actions lookup confirms the exact run ID.
   Any ordinary occurrence of that number in active source, notes, or the
   contribution record remains a strict issue/PR requirement. Confirmed runs
   appear as `workflowRuns` in verification output and the manifest, never as
   PR associations or contributor credit.
   - the manifest is the required input to the rewrite, not an after-the-fact
     audit; it contains every referenced PR, eligible contributor credit,
     inline issue context, every direct commit, and an editorial-eligibility
     classification for PRs and direct commits
   - schema version 3 is the required ephemeral manifest contract. Regenerate
     older manifests; version 2 is not a supported downstream-reader boundary
   - for a historical backfill, add `--seed-ref <pre-backfill-ref>` once so
     contribution records from the prior changelog are retained even when an
     older merged commit omitted its PR number; the verifier excludes records
     for work reverted after the base tag, including beta work reverted before
     the stable release
   - generated provenance reports in-range PRs separately from retained
     seed-only PRs, then states the unique row total. A PR present in both
     inventories counts as in-range; never describe the seed-inclusive total
     as work merged in the current release range
   - add repeatable `--shipped-ref <prior-shipped-tag>` when the reachable main
     closeout differs from the shipped tag or later forward-port commits
     re-associate PRs that were already released. Each tag is a cumulative
     shipped boundary: the verifier unions explicit PR rows from complete
     contribution records in numbered release sections, excludes only overlapping PRs,
     and ignores `Unreleased`. Never infer this boundary from the base SHA,
     target prose, or target record. The manifest and generated provenance retain
     each tag plus the exact excluded PR inventory and count for deterministic
     candidate validation
   - source PR discovery bounds GitHub commit associations to the selected target
     history, or the frozen main history for canonical carriers. A contextual
     source reference becomes a contribution only when its merged commit is
     reachable in the target history and its merge time is within the target.
     Keep all references resolvable, but do not promote unrelated PRs merely
     because they merge while release preparation continues. Explicit seeds
     retain their historical membership and remain seed-only unless independently
     proven in-range. Resolve every association page; existing canonical,
     cherry-pick, and provenance contracts remain authoritative.
   - explicit multi-commit reverts require a revert subject and one standalone
     `Reverts <full SHA> and <full SHA>.` declaration (comma-separated lists
     with final `and` also work). The exact ending ` to restore the previous behavior.`
     is accepted. Duplicate, abbreviated, embedded, or repeated declarations do
     not establish reversal. Each named commit must be a single-parent ancestor,
     and reverse-applying all named patches must reproduce the complete revert
     tree. Recognized declarations that fail this proof stop verification. Proof
     uses private Git index/object storage without hooks or external diffs;
     canonical single-revert and revert-of-revert accounting stays intact.
   - canonicalize backports to the original merged PR on `main`: explicit
     cherry-pick origins win, then a unique normalized-subject match requires
     the same author and an overlapping changed path. Suppress release/backport
     PRs whenever the corresponding main PR exists on current `origin/main`.
     Keep a release-branch PR only when that change landed there first and has
     not yet been forward-ported to `main`
   - read the manifest before editing `### Highlights`, `### Changes`, or
     `### Fixes`; do not carry old grouped prose forward without re-auditing it
   - inspect linked PRs/issues or diffs for ambiguous commits. Direct commits
     are editorial input, not public ledger rows; infer material user outcomes
     from subject, body, touched files, tests, and nearby commits

4. Rewrite one stable-base section only:
   - use `## YYYY.M.PATCH`
   - do not create beta-specific headings
   - do not leave a stale `## Unreleased` section above the target release
   - if `Unreleased` contains release-bound notes, fold them into the target
     section instead of deleting them
5. Section shape:
   - `### Highlights`: 5-8 bullets, broad user wins first
     - include only a clear user-visible capability or workflow unlock, a
       material reliability/safety fix, a broad cross-surface improvement, or
       a release-defining integration/compatibility milestone
     - every highlight must say what changed for a user in one sentence; use
       one user story per bullet and group its supporting PRs
     - exclude tests, CI, refactors, docs, catalog churn, and implementation
       detail unless the outcome is a material install/update, data-safety, or
       widely visible user improvement
   - `### Changes`: new capabilities and behavior changes
   - `### Fixes`: user-facing fixes first, grouped by impact and surface
   - group related changes/fixes by surface and user impact; avoid one bullet
     per tiny commit when several commits tell one user-facing story
   - `### Complete contribution record`: generated PR-first record after the
     grouped prose; it is the exhaustive accounting surface, not a second
     release summary
6. Preserve attribution:
   - keep `#issue`, `(#PR)`, `Fixes #...`, and `Thanks @...`
   - every human-authored merged PR represented by a user-facing entry needs
     its PR ref and `Thanks @author`, even when the PR had no linked issue
   - every human issue reporter for a `Fixes #...` or referenced bug issue
     represented by a user-facing entry needs `Thanks @reporter` unless the
     same handle is already thanked in that bullet
   - every human `Co-authored-by` contributor on represented user-facing work
     needs `Thanks @handle` when a GitHub handle is known
   - when grouping multiple PRs/issues in one bullet, include every relevant
     PR/issue ref and every human contributor handle in that same bullet
   - multiple `Thanks @...` handles in one bullet are expected; do not drop or
     collapse contributor credit just because the note is grouped
   - if one grouped bullet covers both direct commits and PRs, keep all PR refs
     and thanks, plus any issue refs and human credit from the direct work
   - issues remain normal inline `#NNN` references. Do not add a separate
     linked-issues inventory. The generated PR record keeps source issues
     inline as `Related #NNN` on the PR that shipped them
   - when backfilling an older linked-issues inventory, preserve reporter
     credit inline for every GitHub-confirmed closing PR relationship. Do not
     infer a PR relationship from a generic cross-reference event, invent an
     unrelated PR link for a standalone report, or recreate the retired
     inventory
   - the complete contribution record lists every verified in-range PR and
     explicitly retained seed-only PR exactly once as `**PR #NNN**`. Discovery
     preserves canonical/cherry-pick provenance and requires frozen-history
     membership for contextual references; inline context alone cannot create a
     contribution row. It preserves author/co-author credit and any issue
     references in the original title
   - the provenance arithmetic and unique total must match the rendered PR
     rows exactly; candidate validation rejects malformed or forged counts
   - direct commits remain in the manifest with GitHub-resolved author,
     co-author, issue, and editorial-eligibility data. They inform grouped
     prose but are never rendered as a public `#### Direct commits` dump. Add
     direct-commit credit to a grouped bullet only when it shares an explicit
     closing issue reference or at least two distinctive subject terms
   - the verifier rejects ordinary `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `ci`, `build`,
     `chore`, and `style` PRs in Highlights, Changes, or Fixes. An explicit
     Conventional Commits `!` marker makes any type editorial-eligible; include
     its verified user-facing breaking change and migration guidance with the
     original PR ref and credit. Keep other internal contributions only in the
     complete PR record
   - classify conventional titles from their declared type and scope, not
     incidental words such as `doc` or `build` in their descriptions. For
     untyped titles, retain internal-work signals such as `QA`, `test`, `docs`,
     `refactor`, `lint`, or `CI`; eligibility never replaces the source audit
     that establishes a user-visible outcome
   - do not add GHSA references, advisory IDs, or security advisory slugs to
     changelog entries or GitHub release-note text unless explicitly requested
   - initial release generation keeps its existing credit policy: never thank
     bots, `@claude`, `@codex`, `@openclaw`, `@clawsweeper`, or `@steipete`.
     The separately approved post-docs GitHub body uses its complete verified
     human roster, including `@steipete` when credited
   - do not use GitHub's release contributor count as the source of truth; the
     changelog must carry the complete human credit set itself
7. Sorting preference:
   - security/data-loss and content-boundary fixes
   - transcript/replay/reply delivery correctness
   - channels and mobile integrations
   - providers/Codex/local model reliability
   - install/update/release path reliability
   - performance and observability
   - docs and contributor-only/internal details last or omitted
8. Keep bullets single-line unless existing file style forces otherwise. Avoid
   internal release-process noise unless it changes user install/update safety.
9. Check release-note side conditions:
   - inspect `src/plugins/compat/registry.ts`
   - inspect `src/commands/doctor/shared/deprecation-compat.ts`
   - if a deprecated compatibility record reaches `removeAfter`, remove it when
     proven safe or move it to `removal-pending` and record the blocker; keep a
     due `removal-pending` record only until its documented conditions are met
10. Validate and ship:

- after the manifest-driven rewrite, regenerate and verify the complete
  contribution record before committing:
  ```bash
  node --import tsx .agents/skills/openclaw-changelog-update/scripts/verify-release-notes.mjs \
    --base <base-tag> \
    --target <target-ref> \
    --main-ref origin/main \
    --version <YYYY.M.PATCH> \
    --manifest /tmp/openclaw-release-<YYYY.M.PATCH>.json \
    --write-ledger
  ```
- the command fails when any `#NNN` reference in release history or the
  rendered release section cannot resolve, when reverted work is presented
  as shipped, when a source PR is absent from the contribution record, when
  direct commits are rendered as a public record dump, when non-editorial
  PRs appear in grouped prose, or when an eligible PR author or known
  co-author is missing from that PR's `Thanks @...` credit. It also fails
  before history collection when `--base` is not an ancestor of `--target`,
  when `### Highlights` has fewer than five or more than eight top-level
  bullets, or when the existing prose/record names a PR outside the source
  range. Only an explicit `--seed-ref` may add historical PR inventory; an
  explicit repeatable `--shipped-ref` may subtract PRs proven present in a
  prior shipped tag
- when grouped prose names a PR, that same bullet must retain every
  contributor and linked-reporter credit from its generated PR record
- unqualified `#NNN` references resolve against `openclaw/openclaw`;
  cross-repository references such as `openclaw/imsg#141` remain literal
  text and must not be rewritten as local issue links
- after the GitHub release or prerelease is published, verify every matching
  release page against the same source section:
  ```bash
  node --import tsx .agents/skills/openclaw-changelog-update/scripts/verify-release-notes.mjs \
    --base <base-tag> \
    --target <target-ref> \
    --version <YYYY.M.PATCH> \
    --release-tag v<YYYY.M.PATCH> \
    --check-github
  ```
- add one `--release-tag` for every beta and stable page in the train; a
  `### Release verification` tail is permitted, but any other body drift
  fails the check
- `scripts/render-github-release-notes.mts` is the canonical release-body
  renderer used by candidate validation, publish, and verification. When the
  complete `## YYYY.M.PATCH` section fits GitHub's 125,000-character limit and
  the renderer's matching 125,000-byte safety ceiling, the body must contain
  that exact section including its heading
- when the complete source section exceeds either limit, the renderer keeps the exact
  grouped editorial notes through the line before
  `### Complete contribution record`, then emits that heading with a stable
  link to the full contribution record in the tag-pinned
  `CHANGELOG/records/YYYY.M.PATCH.md` (historical monolithic tags retain their
  original `CHANGELOG.md` record link).
  Never truncate a bullet or partial record, and never hand-author a different
  compact form
- append `### Release verification` only when it fits after the canonical full
  or compact body is chosen. If it does not fit, omit the body tail and retain
  the immutable attached release evidence; never compact a fitting full
  contribution record just to preserve the optional tail
- `pnpm release:candidate` performs this deterministic render check from the
  exact target before it dispatches Full Release Validation, including when local
  generated checks are explicitly skipped
- `git diff --check`
- `pnpm changelog:check` validates the split index, records, and marked docs mirrors
- for docs/changelog-only changes, no broad tests are required
- stage the target release entry, its generated record, and changed index; commit with `git commit -m "docs(changelog): refresh YYYY.M.PATCH notes"`
- push the release branch without rebasing it onto moving `main`
- when all fixes and final notes are committed before fresh full qualification,
  record that commit as both Code SHA and Release SHA; use the same successful
  full parent/attempt and its exact publication bytes for both roles
- only when notes change after Code qualification, require
  `git diff --name-only <code-sha>..<release-sha>` to include
  `CHANGELOG/YYYY.M.PATCH.md` and only that entry, its matching record, and
  `CHANGELOG.md` before optionally using `split-changelog-release-v1`. Additions
  or modifications of the selected entry/record are allowed; renames, deletions,
  other releases, and docs source changes are not. Historical root-only receipts
  retain `changelog-only-release-v1`. The split path
  retains green Code proof and qualifies new Release SHA package bytes. Any
  other changed path requires fresh product qualification

## Post-release docs mirrors

After explicit approval of the docs publication, publish the approved docs
sources and their mechanically flattened changelog in the same source PR.
This is separate from initial release generation; do not run an editorial
rewrite automatically during release preparation or publication.

Render the ordered docs sources into one full Markdown file, even for a large
release or a release spanning several docs pages:

```bash
pnpm changelog:from-docs --version YYYY.M.PATCH \
  --source docs/releases/YYYY.M.PATCH.md \
  --output CHANGELOG/YYYY.M.PATCH.md
pnpm changelog:check
```

Repeat `--source` in the approved reading order for a multipart release. The
converter removes presentation wrappers, turns accordion titles into headings,
expands docs links, and preserves source text, credits, code, tables, and images.
Unsupported markup fails instead of silently dropping content. Its first-line
marker binds the ordered source paths and exact source digest. Checks compare
only marked mirrors against their sources; untouched historical originals stay
in their initial format. Preserve `CHANGELOG/records/YYYY.M.PATCH.md` as the
frozen accounting record when replacing reader prose, and regenerate the mirror
in the same PR whenever its docs sources change.

The approved publication bundle owns source merge, verified docs deployment,
and the later GitHub Release body update as separate recorded steps. After
deployment, freshly read the existing release, then update only its body with
version/statistics, Raw changelog and docs links, one alphabetically deduplicated
verified human thanks roster, and the unchanged release-verification section.
Include verified PR, direct-commit, coauthor, and issue credit, including
`@steipete`; exclude bots. Keep both the 125,000-character and 125,000-byte
ceilings without truncating credits or proof. GitHub owns native avatars and
assets. Verify the body readback, resume only incomplete steps, and never retag,
rebuild, republish assets, or rerun initial publication to replace this body.
The initial history verifier rejects docs mirrors; use the docs-publication
workflow for their verification.

## Extended-Stable Variant

Extended-stable has one release commit and no GitHub Release body. After version
prep and approved backports, regenerate `## YYYY.M.P` with the regular manifest
and original-main-PR provenance rules. Land it by PR, then validate the final
branch tip before tagging. Re-audit after a product backport; a tooling-only
repair needs no changelog entry. Never rewrite a published tag or changelog.

## Quota / API Outage Rule

If GitHub API quota is exhausted, do not idle. Continue work that does not need
GitHub API:

- local changelog rewrite and release-note extraction
- local pretag checks and package/build sanity
- git push/tag checks over git protocol
- npm registry `npm view` checks
- exact workflow-dispatch command preparation

Only GitHub Release creation, workflow dispatch, run polling, artifact download,
and issue/PR mutation need API quota.
