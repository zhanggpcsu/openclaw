# OpenClaw Release Maintainer

Use for a release operation, not ordinary development or advisory mutation.
Read `docs/reference/RELEASING.md` for current policy. Load `$release-private`
when available before resolving private credential locators or host topology;
credential operations use `$one-password`.

## Choose the operation

Read only the references needed for the selected phase:

- Regular beta/stable preparation or publication: [regular release](references/regular-release.md), which routes preparation and phase-specific proof. If the request does not specify stable/full, default to beta; beta authorization does not authorize later stable promotion.
- Backport discovery: [candidate inventory](references/backport-discovery.md). For extended-stable also read [backport preparation](references/extended-stable-backports.md); SDK/config changes need a visible maintenance-risk warning and maintainer decision.
- Extended-stable `.33+` Gateway publication: [extended-stable publication](references/extended-stable-publish.md). Do not use the regular release sequence or inherit GitHub Release/native-app publication.
- Validation selection or failed proof: [validation and confidence](references/validation.md), with `$release-openclaw-ci` for workflow execution and immutable manifests.
- Interrupted publication or registry promotion: [publication recovery](references/publication-recovery.md).
- Native assets: [platform publication](references/platform-publication.md), with `$release-openclaw-mac` for macOS operations.
- Stable postpublish synchronization: [main closeout](references/stable-main-closeout.md).
- Release notes: `$openclaw-changelog-update`, including its separate approved post-release docs-mirror route. Initial release generation keeps its existing format; docs publication does not run automatically during release. Requested announcements: `$release-openclaw-announcement` for Discord, `$release-tweets` for X. Announcements never gate publication and require explicit posting authorization.
- Published artifact verification: `$verify-release`. GHSA operations: `$openclaw-ghsa-maintainer` only with explicit security-workflow authorization.

## Shared release boundaries

Explicit approval is required for version changes and irreversible publication.
A request to cut, publish, or complete a named release carries through its
validated publication and verification; do not ask again unless identity,
channel, scope, or material risk changes. Ship authority for ordinary code is
not release authority.

An operator's explicit approval to do whatever is needed to prepare a named
release is standing authority for the necessary preparation decisions and
repairs. Carry it through candidate and tooling fixes, upgrade/migration design,
reviewed test or security-inventory alignments, isolated proof, commits, pushes,
and validation recovery. Record the decision, its evidence, and the selected
support contract; do not ask again merely because an already-approved class of
work reaches an implementation or verification step. Continue independent work
while resolving a blocker. This authority does not permit hiding defects,
lowering a gate to manufacture success, destructive changes to operator state,
unrelated work, or publication. A prepare-only request still requires a separate
publication instruction before releasing artifacts or a bridge version.

Keep one compact state record using
[the handoff template](references/release-handoff-template.md): effective goal,
version/tag/branch, cut/Code/Tooling/Release SHAs, active parent run and attempt,
successful child artifacts, approved changes, phase and next action. Latest
operator steering replaces superseded scope. Completed evidence stays complete
until a named change invalidates it.

For regular releases, prepare complete notes before freezing **Code SHA** when
possible. If those notes are final, **Code SHA and Release SHA are the same
commit**: one successful fresh full qualification can supply both roles and
their exact publication bytes. Do not create another commit or run solely to
separate the labels. If notes change after qualification, a descendant whose
complete delta includes `CHANGELOG/YYYY.M.PATCH.md` and only that entry, its
matching record, and root index may use `split-changelog-release-v1`
to reuse product proof while qualifying new publication bytes. Any other
source delta, rename, or deletion returns to the Code SHA loop. Historical
root-only receipts retain `changelog-only-release-v1`.
Keep trusted **Tooling SHA** separate; tooling or infrastructure failures do
not justify changing the candidate.

Published versions and final tags are immutable. Reuse successful exact-source
artifacts; do not rebuild or republish as an implicit retry. The active release
is the work queue: no opportunistic moving-main fixes or backports. Classify
failures, repair their owner, retry the affected surface, then reassess rather
than repeating the full release.

Required checks and enforced environment approvals remain required. A passing
sibling lane cannot waive a failure. Native platforms have independent gates;
pending app assets do not hold npm/GitHub finalization or main closeout. Report
proof gaps and pending platforms accurately.
